rsa_oracle
Author: Geoffrey Njogu

Description
Can you abuse the oracle?
An attacker was able to intercept communications between a bank and a fintech company. They managed to get the message (ciphertext) and the password that was used to encrypt the message.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

This challenge launches an instance on demand.
Its current status is: NOT_RUNNING



run the instance

After some intensive reconassainance they found out that the bank has an oracle that was used to encrypt the password and can be found here nc titan.picoctf.net 53483. Decrypt the password and use it to decrypt the message. The oracle can decrypt anything except the password.


Hints 
Crytography Threat models: chosen plaintext attack.

OpenSSL can be used to decrypt the message. e.g openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d ...
The key to getting the flag is by sending a custom message to the server by taking advantage of the RSA encryption algorithm.
Minimum requirements for a useful cryptosystem is CPA security.
